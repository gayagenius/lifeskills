				<h1>ROLES OF POLICE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND IN KENYA IN CONJUCTION WITH 'BORN A CRIME' BY TREVOR NOAH.</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Post- apartheid South Africa is emerging as a new country from years of rule based solely on the color of one’s skin. An important component of the new South Africa is the transformed South African Police Service (SAPS). From a history of brutal and indiscriminate violence, the new police system is attempting to transition into a respectable democratic police organization. Initial transformation began in 1994, soon after the fall of apartheid government and has continued until the present.</p>

<h3>Roles of police in South Africa during the apartheid regime-in the novel 'Born a crime'</h3>

<h4>Arrest and fine natives who violated the boundary rule.</h4>

The black natives were not supposed to be found in white neighborhood and the whites weren't to be found in black neighborhoods. Trevor's mum bought a couple of maid’s uniform and wore them while going out, since she was living in a white neighborhood.
'But only black people were permitted in Soweto. It was much harder to hide someone who looked like me, and the government was watching much more closely. 'Segregation of races and areas separated from one another by buffer zones of empty land.'

<h4>Arrest people who were thought to practice witchcrafcy.</h4>

Trevor says if your enemy got struck by lightening you would be summoned in court and evidence would be tabled against you. It would be said that you sent lightening to strike your enemy and the motive behind it was that you had disagreed.

<h4>Arresting black natives who engaged in sexual intercourse with white men.</h4>

It was a crime for a black woman to have sexual intercourse with a white man.If found, the black party was ruthlessly mishandled and arrested. Society built on institutionalized racism, race mixing revealed the system as unsustainable and incoherent.

<h4>Captured and take custody of mixed kids</h4>

It was illegal to be mixed (to have a black parent and a white parent), but it was not illegal to be colored. Colored kids were captured and taken custody of by the government and taken to specific homes for "mixed kids". Trevor had to hide inside his grandmother's house when he went over to Soweto, he couldn't go out and play with other kids since he was a 'colored' kid in a black neighborhood. 'Half black half white violated any number of laws; I was born a crime.''

<h4>To suppress the blacks protestors in Soweto</h4>

'They (police) would swoop in out of nowhere with 'hippos', you saw one you ran. The township was in a constant state of insurrection, someone was always protesting and had to be suppressed.'
Shoot riot crowds in 'black neighborhoods'
From Trevor's grandma's house, he would hear, gunshots, screams teargas being fired into crowds. 'Military could lock us in to quell any rebellion, if the monkeys tried to break out of their cage Air force could flyover and bomb the shit out of everyone.

<h4>Guard and have base operations in black neighborhoods.</h4>

In white areas you rarely see the police, if you did it was officer friendly in a college shirt and pressed pants.in Soweto the police were an occupying army, they wore riot gear, and they were militarized and operated in teams known as flying squad.
