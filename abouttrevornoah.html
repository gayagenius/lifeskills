<p> A free press cannot exist outside a free society, and South Africa is not free. Apart from the laws that directly affect what a newspaper may publish, the apparatus of a repressive state machinery that includes restrictions on freedom of movement, that limits the right of specified people to gather and meet with whomsoever they wish, and that is armed with a veritable armory of restrictive legislation on political activity, must inevitably affect the press.</p>

<p> Not only is the gathering of news limited, but such an atmosphere of fear and caution is infused that newspaper editors are intimidated into effectively censoring themselves. The legislation which is aimed at controlling newspapers or indirectly affects what may and may not be published is often vague in its implications. But in the overall atmosphere of South Africa, it has a very limiting effect.</p>
 <p>In a recent discussion broadcast over the South African Broadcasting Corporation, Allister Sparks, Deputy Editor of the Rand Daily Mail said: Very frequently we have information which we suppress, in order to err on the side of caution, because we are not quite sure how these vague laws are going to be put into effect. The Prisons Act is a case in point. </p>
 <p>There is no newspaper in South Africa today that will publish any information about conditions in prison unless it comes from the Department itself. The prohibitions under the Suppression of Communism Act 1950 are so widely phrased that, in the words of Mr. Alex Hepple ' (they) endanger the right of every forthright critic of baaskap Nationalism, every advocate of a welfare state, every socialist, and every proponent of a non-racial democracy in South Africa, to freely publish their opinions '-1 In a now oft repeated but still valid phrase, a South African editor once described the task of editing a paper in the country as ' walking blindfold through a minefield'. </p>
 <p>Since then, newspapers have been closed down, journalists sentenced to imprisonment and editors and owners charged. The situation was described more aptly by another editor as follows: We are no longer walking blindfold through a minefield. Several of those mines have already exploded at our feet and the continued freedom is in jeopardy.</p>
