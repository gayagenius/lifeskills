				<h1>The treatment and role of women in the novel 'HOMEGOING' by Yaa Gyaasi.</h1>
				<h4>Based on chapter 1&2(Effia &Esi)</h4>
				<h5>Introduction</h5>
				<p>The primary form of inequality explored in Homegoing is <strong><em>racial inequality</em></strong>, but throughout the novel, Gyasi also reveals the ways in which racism intersects with<strong> <em>gender.</em> </strong>For both men and women, rigid gender stereotypes become a large factor in the way that they are <strong><em>violently oppressed</em></strong>: for women, the patriarchal societies on both the Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana) and in America lead to a lack of autonomy and <strong><em>sexual violation;</em></strong> for men, assumptions of strength and anger lead to brutal working conditions and<strong> <em>physical degradation.</em></strong></p>

				<p> For the female characters in the book, the opposite assumption is made: the oppression of women is not in order to make them feel weak, but based on sexist assumptions of their weakness. Thus, in addition to being brutalized, women are often unable to find autonomy or jobs, instead being controlled by men and often sexually violated. From the very beginning of the novel, men control the fates of Maame and her two daughters: Maame was been raped as a house girl before escaping to her old village. Her first daughter, Effia, When Cobbe comes home and discovers what happened, he and Baaba fight into the night, and he beats her for the cruel way she treated Effia. This begins a cycle: Baaba beats Effia; Cobbe beats Baaba.While Baaba treats Effia poorly, Cobbe protects her because she is in fact biologically related to him. This cycle of beating also demonstrates how women experience violence at the hands of both women and men.</p>

				<p>Effia is also married off by her father to a British officer named James Collins. Maame's other daughter, Esi, is sold by the same officer and sent to America. Before she leaves, she is subjected to terrible conditions inside the women's prison of the Cape Coast Castle. She watches as women are starved, abused, and have their babies taken away. She, like many others, is also raped by a soldier. Other characters also endure sexism: on the Gold Coast,<strong><em> women are largely responsible for watching over the children and cooking, and men control their fates.</em></strong> </p>
				<h5> "Weakness is treating someone as though they belong to you. Strength is knowing that everyone belongs to themselves."</h5>

			 <h2>How different the role and treatment of women is today.</h2>

			<p>Women's roles in the world today are, like everything, forever changing. In the novel 'Homegoing' their role was to do all house cleaning and 'maid' work as well as being the prime parent to take care of the children.
			In the modern day, Feminism is a popular topic among politics, social platforms, and even schools. Feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. One thing that women have received through their stand towards feminism is that Hillary Clinton had a big chance of becoming the first female president. Women are also more independent away from men in the modern day. It is more common now to find a woman to be single, taking care of a child, and having a full time job or going to school.</p>


			<h5>conclusion</h5>
			<p>Looking in the future, I could see women getting a overall pay raise and becoming more and more prominent in politics. (Look at Hillary) But  fellow ladies, thank you for giving life to all of us. Mom, if it wasn't for your hard work, I don't know where I would be right now!</p>
